<p class="text_left">"Lost both my lifelines to covid. Without Aai (mother) and Baba (father), 
    nothing will be the same. Everything fell apart in a month. My home, dreams, everything," said the 
famous <span class="heading">Indian youtuber Bhuwan Bam.</span> He lost both of his parents due to COVID-19 during the lockdown in
the month of June 2021. He is only of 21. He is finding it really difficult to restatrt his life after
this sad incident. But even after this, he has been very strong and has said that, "Can't wait to see them again. I wish the day comes soon".
He has restarted his life and is performing really well again. He wishes to make his parents proud anywhere
they are. Losing parents in such a young age and restarting the life with same courage takes a lot.
Bhuwan has proven that anyone can cope out of difficult situations and restart their lives.

    <p class="text_right">"I am sheltering in place alone, but not lonely. I miss my Mama. She passed on Friday, January 24, 2020,
         after five weeks in the hospital. Besides being my mother, she was my housemate and best friend. 
         The eldest of her six children (two boys and four girls), I am her next of kin. I am the one 
         everyone looked to when it came to making decisions. I am the facilitator and advocate on behalf 
         of our family. Now, walking through the house we shared and where I grew up, her presence is all 
         around me. I hear her voice and see her everywhere. Mama left 
        many wonderful, sunshine memories. As I grieve her, I am sheltering in place alone, but not lonely."

             future, but we cannot make plans; the future is unknown. She talks about her frustration
              with online classes; I tell her what she should do, she seems annoyed. I complain about 
              my transition to online classes, she listens, I think she might be annoyed, she has 
              heard it all before. I comment on how crowded the streets and sidewalks are, she rolls her eyes.  We take deep breaths until one of us changes the subject, and

                    <p class="text_right">"I was a gym trainer before COVID-19. I was really earning good.
                        I used to have about 8-10 sessions at different places each day. After outbreak of Coronavirus,
                        my gyms paid me for about 3 months but later on due to lack of funds, they also could not pay.
                        I was conducting my sessions in online mode, but I was unable to make money. As I was only one 
                        earning member of my family, it was a real tough time to manage everything. In this time,
                        my mom suffered COVID-19. I sold my watches, gadgets and almost everything I had to
                        arrange money but she died to lack of medicines in later stages. This question will alwayds
                        remain in my heart if I was a good son. Now, I have responsibilities of my younger siblings and
                        I am giving my 100 percent for this." said <span class="heading">Robin from Canada.</span></p>
